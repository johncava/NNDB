#Implementation of Nearest-Neighbor-Based Rare Category Detection

#Retrieve kd-trees from scikit learn
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree

#require samples (S) and probability of rare class (p)
def nndb(S, p):
    #Define n as the number of samples
    n = len(S)
    #Define r_prime
    r_prime = float("inf")
    #Define K = np, where n is the number of samples, and p is the probability of the rare class
    K = n*p
    #Create KDTree from data
    tree = KDTree(S)
    #For each example, calculate the distance to it's Kth neighbor
    for example in S:
        distances, indices = tree.query( example , k = K)
        #Set r_prime to the minimum distance
        for dist in distances:
            if dist != 0 and dist < r_prime:
                r_prime = dist
    #Create a cardinality list N_i
    N_i = []
    #For each example, create a hyperball with radius r_prime
    for example in S:
        indices = tree.query_radius(example, r = r_prime)
        #Get the number of closest other examples within r_prime radius
        N_i.append(len(indices))
    #Conduct the for loop to increase hyperball radius
    for t in xrange(1,n + 1):
        #TODO:
        #For every example in S - that hasn't been selected
            #Define S_i = max (N_i - N_j) with x_j i NN(x_i, t*r_prime)
            #Else set S_i = float("-inf")
        #Then Query x = argmax S_i, with x_i in S
        #If label of x is 2, break
